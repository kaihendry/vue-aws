# Goal

Using AWS services from VueJS in whilst authenticated from the browser.

Since JSFiddle can't be use for [VUE](http://vuejs.org/) component files, I
guess the only way to do this is to setup an entire Github project to
demonstrate my issue

# To run

	yarn
	npm run dev

Authenticate with a Google account
